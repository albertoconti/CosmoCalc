Cosmological Calculator App

Brooke Simmons and Stuart Lowe worked on turning Ned Wright's Cosmology Calculator into a Mac Desktop widget. This involved a lot of re-furbishing of the original Javascript so that we could allow an array of redshifts to be provided and a table of results created.

I imported the code into XCode and used PhoneGap to get a quick app working. Lots of work needs to be done to turn this into a proper app, but it's a neat test.
